# Applications

Tracks the job applications a user has actually sent, snapshotting the resume that was used at the moment it was saved. Backend: `application_table/`, `application_crud/`, `api/application_routes/`. Frontend: `frontend/src/applications/`.

## The model

`ApplicationRecord` (`application_records` table), many per user. Deliberately **self-contained** — `resume_content_snapshot`, `template_id_snapshot`, and `pdf_snapshot` are copied at save time, not stored as a foreign key back to the `ResumeDraft`/`ResumeDocument` that produced them:

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `company_name`, `application_date`, `application_time` | Identifying/tracking fields — `company_name` capped at 200 characters (`ApplicationCreate`/`Update` schemas) |
| `status` | Free-text (`applied`, `interviewing`, `offered`, `rejected`, etc. — non-exhaustive, no DB enum), capped at 50 characters |
| `resume_content_snapshot`, `template_id_snapshot`, `pdf_snapshot` | An immutable copy of the resume as it was when the application was saved |

This is deliberate: a tracked application must survive the user later editing or deleting the draft/document it came from — unlike the career knowledge base, which has no meaning without its owner and cascades on delete, this data's whole purpose is *outliving its source*. `application_records.user_id` still cascades on account deletion, but nothing about a `ResumeDraft`/`ResumeDocument` change ever touches an already-saved application.

## Flow

1. **Create** (`POST /applications/`) — the caller supplies `resume_draft_id` plus tracking fields. The draft must exist, belong to the caller, and already have a finalized document (see [Document Generation](../document-generation/overview.md)) — otherwise `400 Bad Request` ("Finalize this resume ... before saving an application"). The resume content, template id, and PDF bytes are copied server-side from that document; the client never supplies them directly.
2. **List / Get** (`GET /applications/`, `GET /applications/{id}`) — the list view uses a summary schema (excludes the Markdown/PDF snapshot to stay lightweight); the detail view includes the Markdown snapshot (not the raw PDF bytes).
3. **Update** (`PATCH /applications/{id}`) — tracking fields only (company/date/time/status), as an application progresses through its lifecycle. The resume snapshot itself is read-only once saved.
4. **Download PDF** (`GET /applications/{id}/pdf`) — returns the snapshotted PDF bytes as an attachment.
5. **Delete** (`DELETE /applications/{id}`).

## Ownership and access

No PBAC permission required — every route is scoped to the caller's own `user_id` (see [Auth & Authorization](../auth/overview.md#no-pbac-on-manifestcvs-own-routes)). Both the source draft lookup and the application itself are ownership-checked, so a caller can't snapshot another user's finalized resume by guessing a `resume_draft_id`.
